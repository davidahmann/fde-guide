# Hybrid Intelligence System

Use this blueprint when one operational workflow needs a deliberate mix of deterministic software, optimization, classical ML, retrieval, foundation models, and human review. It is not a reason to add every component. The default is the smallest serial path that meets the accepted-outcome, risk, and cost requirements.

Controls: `ARC-001`, `ARC-002`, `ARC-004`, `ARC-005`, `VAL-002`, `CST-001`, `CST-002`, `DEL-001`, `REL-003`.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility | Authority boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Professional work surface | Shows evidence, uncertainty, alternatives, and permitted actions | Users inspect, correct, pause, and approve through this surface |
| Workflow orchestrator | Owns trigger, durable state, budgets, retries, stop conditions, and routing | Cannot bypass policy or source-of-truth verification |
| Deterministic policy and validation | Applies rules, constraints, and business invariants | Runs outside model generation; rejects invalid state/action |
| Optimizer or classical ML model | Produces a bounded score, ranking, forecast, or plan | Versioned input/output contract, threshold, and fallback |
| Retrieval and foundation-model component | Interprets unstructured evidence or produces a typed proposal | Cannot authorize or commit an action |
| Tool and effect gateway | Reads or changes an external system under current policy | Enforces identity, scope, tenant, idempotency, approval, and readback |
| Human reviewer | Resolves ambiguity, exceptions, or high-stakes decisions | Accountable for decisions reserved to people |
| Evidence and operations plane | Retains trace, versions, evaluation, outcomes, and cost | Separate from model-controlled context and evaluators |

## Decision routing

```text
validated input
  -> fixed rule or calculation when sufficient
  -> optimization or ML when objective/label is defined
  -> retrieval and foundation-model interpretation when evidence is unstructured
  -> human review when the result is uncertain, out of policy, high risk, or over budget
  -> policy-gated action and source-of-truth verification
```

Record every consequential routing choice in the [intelligence-selection record](../templates/intelligence-selection-record.md). The selection must name the rejected simpler alternative, the measured reason it was insufficient, the evaluation evidence, the operating budget, and the fallback. `ARC-004`, `ARC-005`.

## State transitions

```text
received -> validated -> evidence_assembled -> proposed
  -> rule_or_human_review -> approved_or_rejected
  -> action_staged -> action_committed -> readback_verified
  -> accepted | repaired | escalated | stopped
```

The domain model owns these states and any permitted transitions. A model may suggest a transition; it cannot cause one. An externally visible completion state requires the corresponding source-of-truth postcondition. `ARC-002`, `REL-003`.

## Trust boundaries

- Treat retrieval, user content, model output, and ML predictions as inputs with provenance—not as policy or authority.
- Hold identities, credentials, permissions, approvals, and effect execution in trusted services below the intelligence components.
- Bind each read and effect to tenant, resource, purpose, current policy, and an explicit release version.
- Run code execution and data transformations in a bounded environment with explicit network and data controls.
- Keep evaluation data, graders, and release approvers outside the system being measured.

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Missing, stale, conflicting, or insufficient evidence | Ask for bounded additional evidence or escalate; do not invent a conclusion |
| Rule, optimizer, ML, or model confidence outside policy | Route to human review or a safer deterministic path |
| Tool, policy, or identity denial | Stop without effect and surface the reason in the work artifact |
| Timeout, budget exhaustion, or partial external effect | Persist state, reconcile with the system of record, then repair, compensate, or escalate |
| Drift in outcome, quality, data, model behavior, adoption, or cost | Constrain/rollback the affected route and create a replayable regression case |

## Telemetry and operating measures

Measure per decision route: eligible volume, route selection, evidence sufficiency, policy denials, human review, accepted outcome, quality/guardrails, latency, resource use, and full cost per accepted outcome. Segment results by route so a cheap deterministic path cannot hide expensive or unsafe model behavior. `VAL-001`, `VAL-002`, `CST-001`.

## Release tests

- Contract tests for every component interface and source revision.
- Deterministic-policy and state-transition tests.
- ML/optimization error, calibration, constraint, and fallback tests where applicable.
- Foundation-model output, tool-trajectory, retrieval-provenance, and adversarial tests where applicable.
- End-to-end outcome and source-of-truth readback tests.
- Route-specific budget, failure, rollback, and human-escalation tests.
- Release evidence that binds the exact component versions, data/world revision, decision policy, user surface, and operations bundle.

Do not promote a route because aggregate metrics look good. Promote the named decision, segment, effect class, and component versions with their own evidence.
