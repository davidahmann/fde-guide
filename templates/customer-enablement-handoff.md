# Customer Enablement and Production Handoff

Open this record at pilot entry. Handoff is complete only when the receiving team demonstrates the operating capability; documentation delivery alone is insufficient.

## Capability-transfer and dependency evidence

Measure whether the receiving team can operate and change the service without hidden delivery-team work. Falling FDE involvement is useful only while accepted outcomes, adoption, safety, reliability, and full cost remain healthy.

| Measure or exercise | Baseline | Exit target | Observed result and window | Evidence source | Owner / decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Representative changes completed by the receiving team without delivery-team intervention | — | — | — | — | — |
| Routine support cases resolved without delivery-team intervention | — | — | — | — | — |
| Delivery-team hours per accepted outcome or compatible change | — | — | — | — | — |
| Unresolved target-specific or parallel production assets | — | 0 or approved time-bounded exceptions | — | — | — |
| Product/platform gaps with an accepted owner and disposition | — | — | — | — | — |

Document temporary support with a scope, owner, expiry, and exit exercise. Do not manufacture self-sufficiency by shifting unmeasured work or risk to operators. `ADP-002`, `FDE-004`, `OPS-003`.

## Knowledge and assets

- [ ] Workflow charter, value case, current-state map, and decision log
- [ ] Architecture, domain model, tool and policy contracts, and data lineage
- [ ] Threat model, evaluation suites, reference worlds, and known limitations
- [ ] Release manifest, environments, dependency lifecycle, and rollback procedure
- [ ] Dashboards, alerts, SLOs, runbooks, kill switches, and reconciliation queries
- [ ] User guide, training material, support intake, and escalation routes
- [ ] Backlog classified as customer configuration, reusable pattern, platform gap, model limitation, operating problem, or retirement candidate
- [ ] Every field-built production asset has a target, product/platform, or retirement owner and normal change path
- [ ] Reuse rights and transfer constraints are recorded for customer-funded, jointly developed, or confidential work

## Artifact ownership and lineage

| Artifact/release role | Authoritative URI | Version or digest | Upstream lineage | Current change owner | Receiving owner | Promotion path | Access/retention | Last verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow charter and value/adoption contract | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Data, domain, and context contracts | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Harness and behavior bundle | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Tool, identity, and policy contracts | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Evaluation suite and release evidence | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| User surface, telemetry, runbooks, and support assets | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Every production row resolves to an immutable version or digest and names both the upstream inputs and the path used to promote a change.

## Acceptance decision

Record accepted, accepted with dated conditions, or not accepted. Include remaining gaps, temporary FDE support, final service owner, next service review, and rollback or retirement trigger.
