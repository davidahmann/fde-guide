# FDE Discovery Pack

## Inherited story and accountable field roles

Preserve the brief as received before improving or reconciling it. Treat it as an evidence-bearing hypothesis, not current truth.

| Inherited claim | Exact source and revision | Sold, stated, or assumed | Commercial status | Limitation or unknown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

| Role | Named person or explicit unknown | Evidence or authority basis | Scope | Verified by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sponsor | | | | |
| Process knower | | | | |
| Operator | | | | |
| Disposition authority | | | | |
| Independent verifier | | | | |

Do not infer the process knower, operator, disposition authority, or verifier from the sponsor. One person may hold multiple roles only when each role has a separate, recorded basis.

## Engagement charter

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow ID | |
| Executive sponsor | |
| Independent sponsor or business-owner backup | |
| Operational owner | |
| Technical owner | |
| Risk owner | |
| Intended users/operators | |
| Receiving service owner | |
| Trigger | |
| Current work product or decision | |
| Initial segment and exclusions | |
| Accepted outcome | |
| Baseline status and evidence | Measured / estimated / unmeasured |
| Target | |
| Measurement window | |
| Verifier | |
| Maximum acceptable failure | |
| Pilot stop conditions | |
| Pilot maximum duration / evidence cutoff / graduation decision date | |
| Continuation mechanism and decision owner | External deployment or renewal / internal funding or sponsorship / other |

Use the machine-readable [workflow-charter template](workflow-charter.json) for the governed decision after discovery.

## Field evidence register

| Evidence ID | Method | Case/segment | Date | Source owner | Redaction/classification | Observation supported | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Interview / shadow / recording / event log / artifact / metric | | | | | | |

## Field claim comparison and accountable reframe

| Claim ID | Class | Statement | Exact source and owner | Scope and limitation | Contradiction or missing evidence | Currentness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | sold / stated / observed / system-enforced / policy-authorized | | | | | current / contested / superseded |

No claim class universally outranks another or grants authority. Observation proves occurrence in scope; system testing proves exact-build behavior; policy remains normative within its revision and scope; a stakeholder assertion proves only that it was stated.

| Material conflict | Affected boundary or outcome | Safe fallback while unresolved | Proposed reframe | Required disposition and authority | Next field move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | continue discovery / bounded kickoff / defer / stop | find owner / observe case / resolve cited conflict |

When field evidence materially changes the brief, use the machine-readable [engagement-reframe record](engagement-reframe.json) to preserve the competing claims, scoped decision, selective downstream impact, and chronology.

## Workflow event log

| Sequence | Actor | Event | Input | System | Decision | Evidence | Effect | Exception |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | | | | | | | |

## Source-of-truth map

| Source ID | Objects | Owner | Read/write | Classification | Freshness SLO | Identity | API maturity | Failure mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | | | | |

## Decision decomposition

| Decision | Deterministic rule | Agent judgment | Human accountability | Required evidence | Postcondition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | |

## Context extraction and operational redesign

Interview notes, recordings, documents, and demonstrations are discovery evidence. They do not become prompts, policy, memory, or production authority until the owning role validates them.

| Candidate knowledge | Observed source and owner | Classification / scope | Type | Validate with | Keep, repair, remove, escalate, or abstract | Production destination / invalidation trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | Public / internal / confidential / restricted | Fact / rule / judgment / workaround / exception / instruction | | | |

Use this table to distinguish current evidence from rules, professional judgment, and historical scar tissue. Keep customer-specific context with the workflow owner. A reusable product or pattern candidate must be sanitized, recurrence-tested, and routed through the [field-learning register](field-learning-register.md); never copy customer data or local policy into a shared artifact.

## Exception taxonomy

| Exception ID | Frequency | Severity | Detection | Current handling | Target handling | Escalation owner | Eval slice |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | | | |

## Operational ontology candidates

| Kind | ID | Source | Identity key | States/relations | Policy | Action | Invariant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entity | | | | | | | |

## Value-verifiability matrix

| Candidate | Annual volume | Minutes/case | Loaded labor/hour | Error rate | Error cost/event | Annualized integration + operating cost | Verifier coverage (0–1) | Adoption probability (0–1) | Residual risk probability (0–1) | Priority ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| | | | | | | | | | | |

```text
gross_annual_value = annual_volume × (
  minutes_per_case / 60 × loaded_labor_cost_per_hour
  + error_rate × error_cost_per_event
)

risk_adjusted_verified_value =
  gross_annual_value
  × verifier_coverage
  × adoption_probability
  × (1 - residual_risk_probability)

priority_ratio = risk_adjusted_verified_value
                 / max(1 currency unit, annualized_integration_and_operating_cost)
```

Use one declared currency and annual period. Bound every probability or coverage input to `0..1`, preserve low/expected/high scenarios, and do not compare ratios built from different units or periods. This ratio ranks qualified candidates; it does not override a hard owner, verifier, authority, safety, or adoption gate. Keep estimated, measured, and realized value separate. Complete the [value-case template](value-case.md) before a pilot decision.

## Assumption and decision log

| ID | Assumption or decision | Evidence | Owner | Test or review date | If false | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | | Open / validated / rejected / superseded |

## Readiness gates

| Charter dimension | Required evidence | Owner | Score (0–4) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Workflow clarity | User, interface, decision, inputs, permitted action, accepted outcome, boundary | Operational | | |
| Context | Owners, source-of-truth rules, revisions, freshness, classification | Data | | |
| Verifier | Independent completion evidence, representative cases, safety slices, isolated graders | Evaluation | | |
| Integration | Typed tool contracts, identity, authorization, duplicate safety, dependency ownership | Platform | | |
| Adoption | User surface, training, review capacity, support, workflow integration | Operational | | |
| Operations | SLOs, alerts, runbooks, rollback, capacity | Operations | | |
| Risk | Threat model, secrets, egress, tenant isolation, prohibited effects, recovery | Security/risk | | |

Copy these seven dimensions and their evidence into `workflow-charter.readiness`. Authenticated authority, accountable ownership, and a lawful data path remain independent hard gates even when the scored dimensions are otherwise strong.

## Adoption and ownership plan

| Capability | Current owner | Receiving owner | Evidence of readiness | Exercise | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow and policy | | | | | |
| Data and tools | | | | | |
| Evaluation and release | | | | | |
| Support and incident response | | | | | |
| Cost and value review | | | | | |
| Retirement | | | | | |

## Stakeholder value and change contract

| Audience | Current work and consequence | Expected benefit | New responsibility or control | Evidence of acceptance | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Executive or operational sponsor | | Outcome, risk, or economics | Fund, unblock, and decide scope | Baseline, guardrails, and value review | |
| Operator or domain expert | | Better evidence, reduced rework, or faster exception handling | Review, correct, escalate, or pause | Shadow comparison, training, feedback, and workload measures | |
| Product or applied-AI team | | Reusable capability or reduced delivery friction | Preserve the customer-specific boundary and own shared changes | Sanitized recurrence evidence and release decision | |

Controls: `FDE-001`, `FDE-002`, `FDE-003`, `FDE-004`, `FDE-005`, `ADP-001`, `CTX-001`, `CTX-002`.

## Cutover plan

| Stage | Traffic | Write capability | Entry gate | Exit gate | Rollback trigger |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offline | 0% | None | Replay fixtures ready | Thresholds pass | Any prohibited effect |
| Shadow | Mirrored | None | Observability complete | Stable slice metrics | Data or policy drift |
| Canary | 1–5% | Staged/reversible | Human review, support, and rollback ready | SLO, adoption, and review thresholds | Error-budget burn |
| Bounded production | Named segment | Policy-gated | Customer owners and runbooks exercised | Outcome, adoption, and continuous controls | Kill-switch or value threshold |
