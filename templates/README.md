# Working Templates

Copy the smallest set needed for one workflow, replace the example values with evidence from the target environment, and keep the artifacts together under version control. A valid template is a structural starting point, not production evidence.

## Engagement and value

| Template | Decision it supports |
| --- | --- |
| [Field-observation log](field-observation-log.md) | What people actually do, including exceptions and workarounds |
| [Engagement reframe](engagement-reframe.json) | Whether field evidence justifies a scoped change to the inherited brief and which dependent work must be reviewed or superseded |
| [FDE discovery pack](fde-discovery-pack.md) | Whether the workflow is bounded, owned, verifiable, and ready |
| [Workflow charter](workflow-charter.json) | Whether to discover, pilot, defer, do not build, promote, pause, or retire the workflow |
| [AI Value Engineering Scorecard](ai-value-engineering-scorecard.json) | Whether the four hard gates and twelve factors support a bounded pilot or lifecycle decision |
| [Value case](value-case.md) | Whether measured outcome improvement justifies full delivery and operating cost |
| [Data-readiness assessment](data-readiness-assessment.md) | Whether the four data planes and decision-critical sources are fit, affordable, and owned for the bounded workflow |
| [Data-context manifest](data-context-manifest.json) | Which exact sources, quality evidence, preparation, labels, outputs, economics, and monitors are bound to design and release |
| [Intelligence selection record](intelligence-selection-record.md) | Which rules, optimization, ML, retrieval, foundation-model, agent, and human options were considered for a consequential decision |

## Solution and assurance

| Template | Decision it supports |
| --- | --- |
| [Operational ontology](operational-ontology.json) | Which objects, states, rules, actions, permissions, and evidence define the domain |
| [System-map manifest](system-map-manifest.json) | Which versioned software and operational relationships help navigation and impact review when system complexity justifies it |
| [Change-impact assessment](change-impact-assessment.json) | Which material-change impacts, owners, validation, review, rollout, and rollback evidence are required |
| [Agent system](agent-system.json) | Where deterministic software, model judgment, tools, people, state, and operations meet when an agent workflow is selected |
| [Behavior bundle](behavior-bundle.json) | Which exact model-route, prompt, harness, context, tool membership, and guardrail bytes the agent uses |
| [Tool contract](tool-contract.json) | Which data and effects a capability exposes and how it is authorized, contained, and verified |
| [Capability manifest](capability-manifest.json) | Which exact capability build is admitted, with what provenance, authority, assurance, and lifecycle |
| [Threat model](threat-model.json) | Which abuses and failures must be prevented, detected, recovered, and tested |
| [Evaluation case](evaluation-case.json) | Which representative condition must succeed, fail safely, or escalate, and who authorizes the expected result |
| [Evaluation report](evaluation-report.json) | Which model- or agent-system claim was tested under which versions, trials, limits, and contamination controls |
| [Handoff envelope](handoff-envelope.json) | What verified state, evidence, remaining work, authority, and budget one worker may pass to another |
| [Architecture decision record](architecture-decision-record.md) | Why a consequential design choice was accepted and how it can be reversed |

## Executable support skeletons

| Skeleton | Fail-closed role |
| --- | --- |
| [Authorization policy](authorization-policy.mjs) | Deny every request until an implementation supplies an explicit policy decision |
| [Evaluation runner](evaluation-runner.mjs) | Refuse to claim an executed trial until a real runner replaces the skeleton |
| [Evaluation world](evaluation-world.mjs) | Represent the canonical template as not executed |
| [Reference runtime](reference-runtime.mjs) | Refuse workflow execution until an implementation replaces the skeleton |
| [Operator surface](operator-surface.mjs) | Refuse to imply that an adoption plan is an implemented review interface |
| [Operations bundle](operations-bundle.mjs) | Refuse health, kill-switch, or rollback claims until controllers are wired |

## Delivery and operation

| Template | Decision it supports |
| --- | --- |
| [Delivery and adoption plan](delivery-and-adoption-plan.md) | How the vertical slice, acceptance, rollout, enablement, and ownership transfer will run |
| [Solution release](solution-release.json) | Which compatible model- or agent-system artifact bundle is approved for which segment and rollout |
| [Production service readiness](production-service-readiness.md) | Which target-specific service boundaries are required, designed, tested, operational, unresolved, or inapplicable before rollout or handoff |
| [Customer enablement handoff](customer-enablement-handoff.md) | Whether the receiving team can operate, change, recover, and retire the service |
| [Production service review](production-service-review.md) | Whether to expand, constrain, pause, improve, or retire the live workflow |
| [FDE and applied-AI portfolio review](fde-portfolio-review.md) | How to compare stage flow, accepted value, continuation, full delivery economics, reuse, and capacity across multiple workflows without overriding service gates |
| [Field-learning register](field-learning-register.md) | Which recurring field signal becomes a customer fix, platform change, documented pattern, or rejected proposal |

The current evaluation-report and solution-release JSON contracts are model/agent release profiles. A deterministic, optimization, or classical-ML-only system should use the target software release process with equivalent versioned data, model/code, policy, evaluation, operations, rollout, rollback, and ownership evidence; do not invent an agent system merely to satisfy these templates.

Follow the full sequence in the [FDE playbooks](../playbooks/README.md). JSON artifacts declare a local schema and are checked by `npm run validate`.
