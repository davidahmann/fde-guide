# Invoice Exception Reference System

## Objective

```text
invoice exception event
  -> gather ledger/vendor/policy evidence
  -> propose resolution
  -> validate invariants
  -> authorize and stage
  -> approve exact proposal digest
  -> reauthorize and commit idempotently
  -> reconcile any effect-unknown timeout
  -> read back ledger state
  -> completed receipt | compensation + incident
```

## Execute

```bash
npm test
```

## Effect invariants

- `resolution_commits(tenant_id, business_operation_id) <= 1`
- `runtime.release_digest == admitted_solution_release.digest` before reads and effects
- `commit.invoice_revision == current_invoice_revision`
- `commit.proposal_digest == approval.proposal_digest`
- `commit.policy_revision == current_policy_revision`
- `caller.tenant_id == invoice.tenant_id`
- `current_caller_scopes` and `current_policy_revision` are checked at each data/effect boundary
- `committed == true` only after source-of-truth readback
- `effect_unknown` is reconciled before retry or completion
- `completed == true` only after trusted receipt and readback-attestation verification
- `steps`, `wall_time`, and `cost` stay within the declared runtime budget
- `model_access(credentials) == false`

## Scope of the example

This example demonstrates the controlled-write core: exact release admission, contracts, current policy and identity checks, approval binding, duplicate-safe execution, effect-unknown recovery, signed service evidence, source-of-truth verification, runtime budgets, adversarial cases, and privacy-minimized trace evidence.

Its workflow charter contains illustrative values. The solution release remains `review`, capability manifests remain `candidate`, signatures and registry records use non-production example identities, and evaluations run in an ordinary host process rather than an isolated production sandbox. It does not claim field observation, authenticated production provenance, customer adoption, realized business value, deployment approval, or a completed customer handoff; use the [FDE playbooks](../../playbooks/README.md) for those engagement and operating artifacts.
