# Field Engagement and Accountable Reframing

Use this playbook when an FDE inherits a customer request, sold brief, statement of work, or existing delivery plan. The inherited brief is a hypothesis about the work, not authority, observed truth, or a commitment to automate its proposed solution.

The purpose is to keep delivery moving when field reality contradicts the inherited story. The result is a current, evidence-backed engagement boundary with a safe next move—not a silently rewritten brief.

## The field loop

```text
inherit the story
  -> find the people who know and own the work
  -> observe one representative case and one material exception
  -> compare sold, stated, observed, system-enforced, and policy-authorized claims
  -> expose a consequential conflict
  -> propose a bounded reframe and safe fallback
  -> obtain a scoped human disposition
  -> update only dependent work and preserve history
  -> take the next accountable field move
```

Repeat the loop when new evidence invalidates the current boundary. Do not wait for design or build work to finish before surfacing a material contradiction.

## 1. Preserve the inherited story

Record the brief exactly enough to test it:

- the proposed workflow and desired outcome;
- who supplied or sold it;
- the source passages and revision;
- assumptions about users, authority, data, exceptions, acceptance, and economics;
- which statements are commitments and which are still hypotheses.

Do not improve the brief while recording it. A cleaned-up paraphrase can erase the contradiction that must be resolved.

## 2. Separate the roles

Name these roles independently. One person may hold several roles, but each role needs its own evidence or authority basis.

| Role | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Sponsor | Who wants the outcome or funds the work? |
| Process knower | Who can explain how representative and exceptional cases actually move? |
| Operator | Who performs, reviews, or receives the work? |
| Disposition authority | Who may accept, reject, defer, or constrain this engagement reframe? |
| Verifier | Who can independently determine whether the accepted outcome occurred? |

Do not infer the process knower from title, the disposition authority from sponsorship, or the verifier from delivery ownership.

### Find the process knower

Start with the work rather than an organization chart:

1. Trace a recent case from trigger to recorded outcome.
2. Ask who resolves exceptions, corrects records, or receives escalations.
3. Inspect the queues, runbooks, policy passages, workarounds, and system states they use.
4. Ask the first interviewee who they call when the documented path fails.
5. Confirm the candidate against a representative case and a material exception.

If no process knower or representative case is accessible, record the constraint and continue discovery, defer, or stop. Do not manufacture certainty from sponsor interviews.

## 3. Observe representative work

Use the [field-observation log](../templates/field-observation-log.md). Observe at least one actual or sanitized recent case inside a stated population and record:

- trigger, actors, inputs, decisions, handoffs, tools, and recorded outcome;
- normal path, exception path, workaround, and recovery;
- exact source passages, dates, owners, revisions, and limitations;
- whether the case proves occurrence only or is representative of a wider population.

Observation proves what occurred in its recorded scope. It does not prove frequency, permission, policy, or authorization.

## 4. Compare claims without collapsing authority

Classify each consequential claim:

| Claim class | What it can establish |
| --- | --- |
| `sold` | What was commercially represented or committed |
| `stated` | What a stakeholder said |
| `observed` | What occurred in a bounded case |
| `system_enforced` | What an identified system revision technically permits or prevents |
| `policy_authorized` | What an authoritative policy permits or requires in its scope |

No class universally outranks the others. A policy may authorize behavior without proving actual practice; an observation may prove occurrence without granting permission. Preserve cross-class conflicts until a named authority disposes them.

## 5. Bound the conflict

A conflict is consequential when resolving it could change the workflow boundary, human authority, data use, mechanism, acceptance evidence, cost, timeline, or risk ceiling.

For each consequential conflict, record:

- the competing claim IDs and exact passages;
- affected workflow and outcome boundary;
- what remains safe while unresolved;
- who has disposition authority;
- the downstream work that would change under each resolution.

Do not turn every ambiguity into a steering-committee issue. Use one of three initial movements:

1. find or validate the person who performs or owns the work;
2. observe a representative case;
3. resolve a cited conflict or review a bounded reframe.

## 6. Prepare the reframe

Write a decision brief that contains:

- the inherited claim and the contradicting evidence;
- the proposed current boundary;
- included and excluded behavior;
- retained human authority;
- a safe fallback that can proceed before the decision;
- affected acceptance evidence, economics, schedule, and downstream artifacts;
- the exact decision required, by whom, and by when;
- the next field move under accept, reject, defer, or no decision.

The reframe is a proposal. Model output, an FDE recommendation, elapsed time, or a funding deadline cannot accept it.

## 7. Record a scoped disposition

The disposition authority records one engagement decision:

- `continue_discovery` — evidence or authority is still insufficient;
- `bounded_kickoff` — proceed inside the accepted boundary and named constraints;
- `defer` — preserve the record and conditions for reconsideration;
- `stop` — end the candidate engagement or workflow investigation.

Bind the actor, authority basis, scope, rationale, time, and exact evidence passage. This disposition governs the engagement boundary only. It does not grant production release, data access, tool authorization, customer acceptance, or authority to act in a target system.

## 8. Propagate selectively

After a disposition:

1. preserve the prior brief, proposal, evidence, and event chronology;
2. mark the accepted current boundary and its scope;
3. update or supersede only artifacts that depend on the changed claim;
4. leave unrelated revisions and digests unchanged;
5. record why each downstream item changed, its owner, and rollback or reconsideration condition;
6. route stale or newly conflicting work for review rather than silently regenerating it.

Use the [engagement-reframe record](../templates/engagement-reframe.json) for the living contract and the [field-reframe example](../examples/field-reframe/README.md) for a worked case.

## Exit conditions

Continue to [Discovery and Value](01-discovery-and-value.md) when:

- the current workflow boundary is source-linked;
- the sponsor, process knower, operator, disposition authority, and verifier are named or explicitly unknown;
- representative work and material limitations are recorded;
- consequential conflicts are resolved or safely bounded;
- the next field move has an owner;
- the engagement disposition is current.

Otherwise continue discovery, defer, or stop. Do not let solution design conceal an unresolved field conflict.

## Controls

- `FDE-001`: separate the people who want, know, perform, decide, and verify the work.
- `FDE-002`: observe representative and exceptional work with governed evidence.
- `FDE-005`: preserve contradictions, obtain scoped disposition, and propagate selectively.
- `CTX-001`: retain source ownership, revision, classification, and freshness.
- `CTX-004`: retain provenance, validation state, and invalidation rules.
- `DEL-002`: review material cross-resource changes as a compatible unit with rollback.

This playbook is field-delivery guidance. It is not production approval, an authorization system, a PSA, a CRM, or a substitute for target-system evidence.
